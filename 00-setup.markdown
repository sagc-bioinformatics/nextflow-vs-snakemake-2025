# Requirements

## 1. BASH

You should have a basic working knowledge of Bash shell. If you need a refresher, please check out:

## 2. Laptop and SSH

You will need to bring a laptop on the day of the workshop to work on exercises. 

A VM on the [Nectar Research Cloud](https://ardc.edu.au/services/ardc-nectar-research-cloud/) will be allocated for you to use. You will be given an address to connect to on the day.

To access the VM, all you will need is a web browser. An instance of Visual Studio
Code will be running.  

Optionally, you can use an SSH (Secure Shell) client to connect directly. The
username is "user", while the password will be provided on the day.

```
ssh user@<provided_address>
```

## 3. Slack channel

We will be using Slack for some communication during the workshop. 
If you have an account on the Adelaide Bioinformatics Hub slack workspace ([bioinformaticshubsa.slack.com]()), please go ahead and join the [#nextflow-snakemake-25](bioinformaticshubsa.slack.com#nextflow-snakemake-25) channel.

If you are not yet part of the workspace, please contact one of the event organisers.
